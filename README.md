Each document is written in Markdown, version-controlled, and linked from the Miro roadmap and Confluence pages.

📌 Purpose

This repository ensures that:

All teams follow consistent documentation standards

Feature specs and rulebooks are easily accessible

Technical decisions are centralized and trackable

Release and QA criteria remain transparent

Publishing/legal requirements stay versioned

🗂 Linked External Docs

These documents are maintained in Confluence, with smart links placed in Miro:

GDD

Technical Specifications

QA & Release Checklist

Feature Specification

Publishing Requirements

If you update any Confluence title, remember to re-paste the link in Miro to refresh its smart-link metadata.

🔧 Branching Model

This project uses a lightweight branching strategy:

main — production-ready documentation only

dev-docs — active work on new documentation

feature/* — optional per-feature docs updates

release/* — locked branches for milestone polishing

archive/ — frozen folders for old versions or deprecated docs

All merges into main must pass Producer/Technical Lead review.

🧭 Maintainers

Producer: Yuliia Kriuchkova

Technical Lead: <name>

Game Director: <name>

Art Director: <name>

QA Lead: <name>

✔ Contribution Rules

Commit meaningful, descriptive messages

Keep documentation modular (one file = one topic)

Avoid large unstructured text blocks

Update diagrams separately in Miro when needed

All major design changes must also be reflected in the GDD
