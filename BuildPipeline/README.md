# Build Pipeline
Automation scaffolding for nightly and milestone builds. Use these folders to store CI templates, packaging scripts, and release metadata.

- `ci_config/` — CI/CD configuration templates and environment files.
- `scripts/` — Build, tagging, and changelog helpers. Document any required secrets or environment variables.
