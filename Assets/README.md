# Assets
High-level placeholder for authored Unity assets. Each child folder mirrors the production layout for hex regions, combat content, encounters, procedural dungeons, UI, and character data. Use `.meta` files when importing into Unity; this repo keeps structural placeholders only.

- `HexRegions/` — Region tiles, biomes, props.
- `Combat/` — Abilities, VFX, animation clips, status effects.
- `Encounters/` — JSON encounter graphs and rewards.
- `Dungeons/` — Procedural generation rules and room templates.
- `UI/` — Prefabs, layouts, icons, fonts.
- `Characters/` — Models, rigs, textures, skins.
